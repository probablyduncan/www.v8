This looks scrumptious! And I'm ready to eat
Got my napkin in my lap and I'm sat in my seat
Got a fork in my hand, glass of milk in the other
Mmm! So fresh straight out of the udder

And butter! On bread right out of the oven
They say good things always come in a dozen
Well this table seats twelve and there's one chair left
And it could be yours, you could be our guest

We got parsley! and sage! and we're having a good time!
You're glad? To see me? The pleasure is all mine!
I'm staring down the barrel of the cornucopia
And I'll be damned as the devil if this isn't utopia

*music*

Rosemary! On roast potatoes
Gooseberry! Sun-dried tomatoes
And there's a whole big pile of hot pancakes
And there's real big smile upon my face

We've got pasties! Like a hundred of those
And there's jam and cream and a mountain of scones
We've got nutbread! and clover honey
And eggs Benedict! whose yolks are runny

And there's turnip! and 'tater! and beetroot pie
We're going deeper! n ever! Mossflower style
In a little bit I can wheel out the cheese
And the dandelion wine and the rosehip tea

And the table's bowed! Is the food too heavy?
It it the five gallon bucket that's full of spaghetti?
I'm ready! To pile up my plate
And do my honorary duty to ease the weight

I see pies a plenty, on the table in front of me
And I've got ten friends and they're all sitting next to me
Last supper! 'til this time tomorrow
When my liver is done turning wine to water

And then I get on the phone, and I call up my friends
And I tell them it's time to do it all again

*music*

I'm like a panda! I eat shoots and leaves
I like tender! stem! broccoli!
I like spinach! and kale! and rainbow chard!
I like a whole lotta things, and it's so hard

To choose! What am I gonna eat now?
Only so much room inside one mouth
You gotta pick something! But it's no big deal
It take more than one bite to make a meal

Oh man! Mmm! This looks delicious
But I'm not gonna lie, I'm a little suspicious
How can so much good be in one place?
If it's so nutritious, then why does it taste

So good! Straight off of the vine
The aroma of tomato is a thing divine
I could eat one carrot, but they come in a bunch
I say what's up doc? Munch munch munch

How do you like them apples? I like them a lot!
I like them like I like oranges! Not store-bought
But from an orchard, on the side of a hill
Where the sun is soft and the world is still

And from this high you can see town below
And the path you took and the land you know
And the grass is green, and there’s a little stream a-flowing
In between the trees, where the fruit is hanging low and

There's a light breeze, butterflies a-flitter
And you can pick a few pears, bring them home to dinner

*music*

I'm done! Nothing left to eat
And I don't know where I'm going but I got these two feet
And I got a full belly and a milk mustache
Oh man! It's not living if it's not like that

Oh man! It's not living if it's not like that
Oh man! It's not living if it's not like that
Oh man! It's not living if it's not like this
Oh man! It's not living if it's not like that
