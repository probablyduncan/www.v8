I know we’re living in apocalypse but I just got a raise
They say there's water on the quarter deck but this quarter I did great
There's nothing wrong with validation, though I know I earned the praise
And it was worth it
Yes it was worth it

They say we're living in hell, but I’ve got a penthouse suite
It's true that life’s a little better when the world is at your feet
There ain't a single thing that I can do about this awful heat
But it was worth it
Yes it was worth it

I may be living in hell, but I've got a penthouse flat
I was fast friends with the super, here; we got on just like that
All I had to do was tip him, he turned down the thermostat
And it was worth it
Yeah it was worth it

I got a raise in the apocalypse and I am feeling fine
They say the elephant in the room is that there aren’t none left outside
But It was hard to see em anyway from on ivory tower high
And it was worth it
Yes it was worth it

I know we’re living in apocalypse but I just got a raise
It makes sense to sell em water when the boats are all ablaze
And there's no harm in eating apples when you've never seen the snake
Why would I have a guilty conscience, just because I know what pays
