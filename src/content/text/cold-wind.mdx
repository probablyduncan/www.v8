There’s a cold wind, and it’s coming here today
There’s a cold wind, and it’s coming here to stay
There’s a cold wind, and it has a lot to say
If you listen to the whistle of the wind

There’s a cold wind, and it’s awful far from home
There’s a cold wind, blowing in between my bones
Telling tall tales of the places it has roamed
When you listen to the whistle of the wind

There’s a cold wind, you can see it in the trees
And the tall grass, and the skittering of leaves
And the branches know this ain’t just another breeze
For they’ve listened to the whistle of the wind

There’s a hot fire, and it’s just around the bend
Of this long road that don’t seem to have an end
There’s a hot fire where I will sit and then
I will listen for the whistle of the wind
