I come from a land where bugs can scream
Where bugs have hopes and bugs have dreams
Where you can hear them when you crush them
When you crush them with your feet

I come from a land where sticks and stones
Where sticks and stones will break bug bones
And you do not need an ear trumpet
To hear their wails and moans and groans
(It’s like they all have megaphones)

I come from a land where bugs can scream
Where bugs can whisper and can scheme
Where bugs can vocalize their problems
And you never need to lip read

I come from a land where bugs can whine
Invertebrates they have no spine
They walk around a little shaky
And when they stroll they take their time

I come from a land where every fly
Knows how to laugh and how to cry
And they all know the bug condition:
To live and live and live and die

I come from a land where bugs are free
To express their identity
When they say something homophobic
They make a quick apology
(They say that they are so sorry)

I come from a land where bugs can flirt
Where bugs can love and bugs can hurt
They have an existential crisis
And the next day they’re back at work
(9am Monday back at work)

I’ve seen the bug society
The bugs have ideology
They celebrate the revolution
It’s a national holiday

I come from a land where bugs are free
They work in the economy
They generate shareholder value
And they all have anxiety
(They all go to therapy)

I come from a land where bugs can read
They all know about history
At buggy funeral proceedings
Somebody reads a eulogy
(We will all miss this bug dearly)

Bug funerals are never terse
And that's for better or for worse
They put a moth into a coffin
And move it with a horse fly hearse

I come from a land where bugs can scream
Where bugs can hope and bugs can dream
You never have to guess what bugs are feeling
Things are always exactly as they seem
