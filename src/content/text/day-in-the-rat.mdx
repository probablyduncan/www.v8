_♫ Sung roughly to the tune of the Beatles’ “A Day in the Life”._

I saw a rat today, oh boy!
With in its paws a bit of bread to save
And though its eyes were rather vile
Well I just had to smile
This park is full of life

And then another one, oh boy
It leapt upon the first to scrap the knave
There soon was blood upon the ground
This world is rat eat rat
Nobody is really sure of what they've got until its gone

Now there's a thousand rats, oh boy
Come from the bushes like a tidal wave
The king of rats is on his way
He stands atop the horde
And waves a toenail sword

The world is onnnlyyyy raaatttsss

_♫ Anxiety-inducing musical interlude_

Got up, and ran away
Gotta keep the rats at bay
Found my way down to the water's edge
And saw more rats, crawling wet out of the lake

Turned around and booked it back
Into the woods, and saw a rat
There were rats above and underfoot
And I tripped on a rat, and I fell into the rats

_♫ Aaah, aaa aahh ahh, etc, etc_

_𝄢 The horns awaken_

I saw a rat today, oh boy
Feels like an omen from beyond the grave
Like I was stuck in Plato's cave
And now I can see
Just how many rats are hiding in between the twigs and leaves

I have to leeeeave thiisss parrrkkk

_♫ Anxiety-inducing outro_
