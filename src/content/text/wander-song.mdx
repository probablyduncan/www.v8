I walk a muddy track down through a field of wilted wheat
I got a map that ended miles ago and blisters on my feet
I don’t know where I’m going and I don’t know who I’ll meet
But I know wherever I go I can’t never linger

I met a lonesome weary lady lying in the mud
She said stranger don’t you like this little grave I dug
She said won’t you lay with me and we’d be like two spuds
I just smiled for a little while and I said I’m bound to wander

I saw a band of merry men were stealing from the pope
They emptied out his pockets, trussed him to a tree with rope
I asked him should I free him and he only just said nope
I asked why, and he said my, I need this time to ponder

I climbed upon a mountaintop, sat on that mighty stone
The view it flew along for miles across the land I roamed
And there in hazy distance was the place I once called home
I heard the beating of my heart and felt it growing fonder

I came upon a scarecrow it was walking awful slow
I said where you even going man and he said I don’t know
He said I never ever had a gut or bones to call my own
He looked at me like a bag of leaves and said I have a hunger

It was autumn when I left, was fall when I returned
It’s hard to cross a river when all the bridges have been burned
But I swam the current mightily and kissed the shore for being firm
They asked me then, oh where I’d been, and I just said over yonder
