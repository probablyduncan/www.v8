title: I just wanna ride horses

It is a necessary complication
I don’t mind the agitation
Some things they just need a little time

Cause when you’re sitting next to me
Well I should be in ecstasy
But there’s one thing I can’t get off my mind

You see I feel a little hesitation
Matrimony trepidation
A door of mine is closing, this is true

Before we up and tie the knot
And settle down and have our lot
There’s one thing that this man’s gotta do

I just wanna ride horses
I just wanna ride horses

I wanna saddle up a restless mare
I wanna run my fingers through her hair
I wanna ride and ride until the sun is low

I don’t know how to make you understand
That this is not a total change of plan
I just feel a little caught in your lasso

I’m not trying here to rile you up
Just trying to say giddy up
What will it take for you to get the gist?

It’s not drama I want to stir up
It’s just I want my foot in a stirrup
And to cross this thing right off my bucket list

*interlude*
*transition to sadder music*

I saw a program on tv
It was horses, strong and free
It made me think: oh what could be!
But I have a fiancé

Oh I could be equestrian
I’d ride into the west and then
I’d be among the best of men
But fate, it seems to taunt: neigh!!

I just wanna ride horses!
I just wanna ride horses!

Before we go the bridal way
I want to ride down a bridleway
Oh, can’t you see, babe, that I have a need

If I could ride a country mile
Before you walk on down the aisle
Just me and my old purebred mountain steed

Yeah I wanna ride horses
I just wanna ride horses
