You think you’ve finally made it out
You think no one can stop you now
Your pants are new, they’re tailor-made
They’re perched up high upon your waist

You think you’re on top of the world
Your oysters all are full of pearls
You think the world is in your hand
You cinch your belt up tighter and...

And then you’re: pantsless again!
And everybody’s laughing and
Your dignity is destitute
It’s in the bin

Oh yeah you’re pantsless again
You feel a slip - a draft - and then
There’s nothing now between the world n’
Your hairy shins
Your hairy shins


You thought at last you’d broken free
But all can see your naked knees
You used to reach and touch the sky
But now your pants are ankle high

Oh you’ve been down this road before
You’re pantsless again
No you can’t take it anymore
You’re pantsless again

Now, the whole party sees
Your dinosaur undees
You’re pantsless!
You’re pantsless again


Pantsless again
And everybody’s laughing and
Your dignity is destitute
You’re in the bin

Oh yeah you’re pantsless again
You feel a slip - a draft - and then
There’s nothing now between the world n’
Your hairy shins
Your hairy shins
Your hairy shins, your hairy shins, your hairy shins...
